## About
This is an UCLID5 model that demonstrates the use of instantiating transitions systems to prove hyperproperties. The Trusted Abstract Platform is a model that describes an idealized enclave platform. It includes primitive operations such as launch, destroy, enter, exit, pause, resume, and measure which are often used in enclave platforms.

## Usage
To run the tap model,
```
cd modules
make tap
```

To run the integrity proof,
```
cd proofs
make
```
