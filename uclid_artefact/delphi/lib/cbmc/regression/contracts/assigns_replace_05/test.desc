This test checks that verification fails when assigns clauses are combined with function contracts
in a loop improperly, i.e., always assumes memory not mention in ensures clauses are unchanged.

BUG: Currently, function call replacement using 'ensures' specifications encodes an implicit assumption that any memory not mentioned in the ensures clause remains unchanged throughout the function, even when an 'assigns' clause is not present.
