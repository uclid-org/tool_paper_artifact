## About

This UCLID5 model demonstrates a microarchitectural (specifically, a microarchitectural happens-before or "Âµhb") model that uses both operational (through the ```init``` and ```next``` keywords) and axiomatic modelling (through the ```axiom``` keyword).

The model describes a microarchitecture with 3-stage pipelines where instructions are fetched in program order.

## Usage
To run this example, execute the following command:
```shell
uclid uhb_common.ucl operAx.ucl
```
