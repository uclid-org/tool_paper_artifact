This example corresponds to Figure 4 in our submitted paper. It demonstrates how to use
UCLID5's synthesis syntax.

The model in fib.ucl represents a simple Fibonacci sequence with a partial
proof of the property that the numbers in the sequence always increase. The
proof is partial because the property is not inductive. UCLID5 is able to
complete the proof using a syntax-guided synthesis engine. \textbf{Running
run\_Fib.sh should take around 10 seconds.}
